This project presents a Medical Image Recognition system built using Deep Learning techniques to classify medical images into different categories. The primary objective is to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect patterns in medical images and assist in early diagnosis and decision-making. By applying artificial intelligence in healthcare, this system demonstrates how image-based analysis can support medical professionals with accurate and efficient predictions.

The project begins with data preprocessing, where images are resized to a consistent shape and normalized to ensure uniform input for the model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate performance effectively. Image preprocessing and cleaning help improve model stability and prediction accuracy.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is developed using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction, activation functions such as ReLU for introducing non-linearity, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers with a Softmax activation function for classification. The model is compiled with an appropriate optimizer and loss function to enhance training efficiency.

During training, the model learns important features from medical images and continuously adjusts weights to minimize loss. Performance metrics such as accuracy and loss are monitored throughout the training process. Visualization techniques are used to compare training and validation accuracy, and evaluation methods such as confusion matrices help assess classification performance.
